            <h1>About this app:</h1>
            <p>The application is written in C++, using the WinForms framework. The main file takes up only 88 lines, because it does not contain 
                complex logic. The Create button is responsible for creating a new line, the Save button saves all lines to the "output.txt"
                file, I think it is unnecessary to talk about deleting and editing. It is also worth noting that the form designer synchronizes 
                lines from the "output.txt" file, all lines are immediately written to the application without the need for the user to do this
                manually (at first this was a function of a separate button), I decided not to synchronize it with the database, but to leave the i
                nteraction with the lines through the file.</p>
